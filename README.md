To run this, use Google Colaboratory: https://colab.research.google.com/

You may need to make an account. I paid $10 for a month of Colab Pro, to get a faster runtime. This is unnecessary, but your code may run slower.

Instructions:

1. Unzip GroupmeGenerator.ipynb (if zipped).

2. Upload the GroupmeGenerator.ipynb file to Colab (File > Upload notebook...)

3. Follow the directions at the top.
